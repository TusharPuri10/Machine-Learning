# Machine-Learning
- 🕐👀 Few months ago, I attended a workshop on Machine Learning and it's applications and ever since I was fascinated by this field and wanted to learn about the algorithms.
- 🎯 By creating this repository I can track my learning consistency so, that I can build a Machine Learning based project and get hands on the application part.
